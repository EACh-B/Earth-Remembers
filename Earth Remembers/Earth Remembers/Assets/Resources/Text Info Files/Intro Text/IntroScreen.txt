Welcome to Earth Remembers.

Climate Change is a growing threat to the entire world, and it is your job as climate change negotiators to allocate funding to try and stop this threat. You will soon be assigned a country and an alliance by the host of the game (which you must then select on the next screen) and it is your job to negotiate with members of your own and other alliance to decide how your money should be spent.  

You can choose to spend in the following 4 areas: 
 • Adapting to the effects of climate change.
 • Mitigating climate change through emission reduction 
 • Donating to the International Climate Fund
 • The remainder of your budget will go towards non-climate change spending. 

Good luck!
